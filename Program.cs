Through this game, you've seen firsthand the power of security measuresâ€”how even a single password manager or an input filter can prevent an attack and save millions. The takeaway? Cybersecurity isn't just a layer; it's a lifeline. So, whether you're on the offense or defense, consider what you've learned, and recognize the critical role you play in a digital society.");
